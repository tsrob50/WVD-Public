.SYNOPSIS
    Automated process to stop unused session hosts in a WVD personal or pooled host pool.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script is intended to automatically stop pooled or personal host pool session hosts in an Azure Virtual Desktop
    host pool. The script will evaluate session hosts in a host pool and create a list of session hosts with
    active connections. The script will then compare all session hosts in the personal host pool that are 
    powered on and not in drain mode, and shut down the session hosts that have no active connections.

    Requirements:
    WVD personal host pool with Start on Connect enabled 
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/start-virtual-machine-connect?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004159
    An Azure Function App
        Use System Assigned Managed ID
        Give Virtual Machine Contributor and Desktop Virtualization Reader rights for the Session Host VM Resource Group to the Managed ID
        Az powershell modules enabled
    For best results set a GPO to log out disconnected and idle sessions (Users have to disconnect or the session hosts won't shut down)
    For help with setting the schedule:
